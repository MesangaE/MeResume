               * Designed CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, docker, and AWS) committing code in Github with built environments (Dev, stage & Prod), 
                 using Jenkins, reducing release cycles by 50%. Maven integrated with Nexus for artifact storage. SonarQube is used for code analysis
                  with appropriate quality gate implementation, and Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring and visualization. Slack for feedback

               * CloudFormation/terraform modules, for provisioning and management of infrastructure and Parameter Store, 
                  enabling reusability and discouraging value hardcoding.

               * I configured the remote backend for the Terraform state file with an S3 bucket and DynamoDB 
                  table as a lock for the file, reducing manual intervention and errors by 70%.

               * Ansible for the continuous deployment of the monolithic application and orchestration with Jenkins.

               * Collaboration with different teams using agile methodology with Kanban for project facilitation.

               * Docker and Kubernetes to isolate and pack software and dependencies by automating their deployment
                and scaling with minimal errors.<p>

                  * Implemented IAM best practices and role-based access control for AWS accounts, ensuring the least privileged access.

                  * Client collaboration for product improvement.

                  * Multi-part upload of clients' old data to S3 buckets, implementing versioning, life-cycle management, 
                  automating backups from their local system buckets, and preventing accidental deletion and vault-locking confidential documents.

                  * Proposed high-performing, available, resilient, and efficient 3-tier architecture for client's applications.

                  * I also proposed a real-time data pipeline for a piece of field machinery, using AWS (AWS IoT, AWS Glue, Kinesis data streams, 
                    Redshift, Athena, and S3 using Quick Sight for visualization).

                  * I created static websites for different projects using a CloudFront distribution for speedy content distribution, 
                  Route 53 for traffic routing to the distribution and AWS Certificate manager to store the certificates ensuring website safety.

                  * Created Pre-signed URLs for access to private company S3 buckets when needed<p>
